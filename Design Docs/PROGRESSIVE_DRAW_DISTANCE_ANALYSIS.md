# Comparative Analysis: Progressive Draw Distance

This document compares the implementation of the Progressive Draw Distance feature in Crystal Frost with other popular Second Life viewers.

## Crystal Frost Implementation

*   **Method:** Uses a coroutine to smoothly interpolate the draw distance from a minimum value to the user's target value over a fixed period of time (`RampUpTime`).
*   **Trigger:** Activates when a teleport is completed.
*   **Configuration:** `MinDrawDistance`, `TargetDrawDistance`, `RampUpTime`.
*   **Pros:** Provides a very smooth visual transition.
*   **Cons:** Slightly more complex to configure than a simple step-based approach.

## Firestorm Viewer Implementation

*   **Method:** Uses a "stepping" approach. The draw distance starts at 32m and then doubles at a user-configurable time interval until the target draw distance is reached.
*   **Trigger:** Activates when the user teleports or changes their draw distance setting.
*   **Configuration:** A single slider for the time interval between steps.
*   **Pros:** Simple for the user to understand and configure. The doubling approach quickly rezzes the immediate surroundings.
*   **Cons:** The "stepping" can be visually jarring compared to a smooth interpolation.

## Official Second Life Viewer

*   **Method:** The official viewer has a more advanced feature called "Auto-FPS" which is part of the "Performance Improvements" updates. This system dynamically adjusts a range of graphics settings, including draw distance, to maintain a target frame rate.
*   **Analysis:** This is a more holistic approach to performance management than a simple progressive draw distance feature. It's a good long-term goal for Crystal Frost, as noted in our `ROADMAP.md`.

## Conclusion

The current implementation in Crystal Frost is a solid first step. It provides a smooth and visually appealing way to handle the rezzing process after a teleport.

Compared to Firestorm, our approach is smoother but less aggressive. We could consider adding a "stepping" mode as an option in the future to give users more control.

Compared to the official viewer, our feature is more limited, as it only addresses draw distance. The official viewer's "Auto-FPS" system is a more comprehensive solution that we should aim to replicate in the future.

For now, our current implementation is a valuable improvement to the user experience.
