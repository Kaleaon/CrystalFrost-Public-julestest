# Crystal Frost Viewer Roadmap

This document outlines a roadmap of potential improvements for the Crystal Frost viewer. It is a living document that can be updated as the project evolves.

## To Make it Better (Improve Stability and User Experience)

*   **Build a Comprehensive Test Suite:** The project is set up for testing with `Moq`, but it needs a suite of unit and integration tests. This is the most critical step for ensuring stability and preventing bugs as new features are added.
*   **Enhance Logging and Error Reporting:** A robust system for logging and automatically reporting errors or crashes would make it much easier to find and fix issues that users encounter.
*   **Focus on UI/UX:** A polished, intuitive, and responsive user interface is key to a good user experience. Investing time in designing and implementing a high-quality UI using Unity's tools would be a major improvement.

## To Make it More Efficient (Improve Performance)

*   **Systematic Profiling:** Use Unity's Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks. Regularly profile CPU usage, memory allocations (to reduce garbage collection), and rendering performance.
*   **Optimize Asset Handling:** The systems for loading meshes, textures, and animations are central to performance. You could explore more advanced asset bundling, texture compression, and caching strategies to reduce memory usage and loading times.
*   **Embrace Data-Oriented Design (DOTS):** For a significant performance leap, consider migrating performance-critical systems to Unity's Entity Component System (ECS). This is ideal for rendering the massive number of objects and avatars found in a virtual world.

## To Add More Advanced Features (Improve Architecture and Extensibility)

*   **Complete the Architectural Documentation:** The `Design.md` file is a good start, but it's incomplete. A clear, up-to-date architectural document is essential for guiding future development and making it easier for new contributors to join the project.
*   **Leverage the Universal Render Pipeline (URP):** Unity's URP makes it much easier to add advanced graphical features like custom shaders, post-processing effects, and modern lighting. This is a key advantage over older viewers.
*   **Develop a Modular/Plugin Architecture:** Continue building on the existing service-based architecture to create a system where new features can be developed as independent modules or plugins. This would make the viewer highly extensible and customizable.
